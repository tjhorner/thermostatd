# thermostatd

This is the server I use to control my AC/heating unit. To use this, you need to set up lirc on your system and install the patched lircd.conf in this repo (the original can be found [here](https://github.com/mattjm/Fujitsu_IR)). It is compatible with Fujitsu units that use the AR-REG1U remote.

Docs coming soon, maybe. See the `api` folder.
